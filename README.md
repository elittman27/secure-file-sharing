# secure_file_sharing

Secure file sharing system in Go similar to Google Docs where users create accounts, write and read to files, and share and revoke access to files with other users.
Maintains confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of all user account data and files using RSA encryption, HMACs, and digital signatures.
